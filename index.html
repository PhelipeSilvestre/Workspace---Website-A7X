            <h2>Biografia</h2>
            <p>
              Avenged Sevenfold (abbreviated as A7X) is an American heavy metal
              band from Huntington Beach, California, formed in 1999. The band's
              current lineup consists of vocalist M. Shadows, rhythm guitarist
              Zacky Vengeance, lead guitarist Synyster Gates, bassist Johnny
              Christ, and drummer Brooks Wackerman. Avenged Sevenfold are known
              for their diverse rock sound and dramatic imagery in album covers
              and merchandise.[1] The band emerged with a metalcore sound on
              their debut album Sounding the Seventh Trumpet and largely
              continued this sound through their second album Waking the Fallen.
              The band's style had evolved by their third album and first major
              label release, City of Evil, into a more traditional heavy metal
              style. The band continued to explore new sounds with its
              self-titled release and enjoyed continued mainstream success
              before their founding drummer, Jimmy "The Rev" Sullivan, died in
              2009. Despite his death, Avenged Sevenfold continued on with the
              help of ex-Dream Theater member Mike Portnoy, and released and
              toured in support of their fifth album Nightmare in 2010, which
              debuted atop the Billboard 200, their first number one debut.[2]
              In 2011, drummer Arin Ilejay joined the band on tours and
              recording. The band's sixth studio album Hail to the King, which
              was released in 2013, marked the only Avenged Sevenfold album
              featuring Ilejay. It would feature a heavy metal and hard rock
              style, with it being written as a tribute to their influences.
              Hail to the King charted as number 1 on the Billboard 200, the UK
              Albums chart, as well as the Finnish, Brazilian, Canadian, and
              Irish charts. Ilejay left the band in late 2014 and was replaced
              by former Bad Religion drummer Brooks Wackerman, but the lineup
              change was not announced to the public until 2015. The band then
              surprise-released their seventh studio album The Stage in October
              2016, which debuted as number 4 on the Billboard 200 chart in the
              US. The Stage is their first conceptual album and marked another
              stylistic change for the band, moving towards a progressive metal
              sound. The band released their eighth studio album, Life Is But a
              Dream..., a highly experimental record, in June 2023. To date,
              Avenged Sevenfold have released eight studio albums, one live
              album/DVD, two compilation albums and eighteen singles and have
              sold over 8 million albums worldwide,[3] and their records have
              received numerous certification awards, including five platinum
              album awards from their home country's institution (RIAA). They
              have also created four original songs for the Call of Duty: Black
              Ops series, all of which were compiled together in the 2018 EP
              Black Reign. The band were ranked No. 47 on Loudwire's list of Top
              50 Metal Bands of All Time.[4]

              The Rev, born James Owen Sullivan on February 9, 1981, was the
              drummer and primary songwriter for Avenged Sevenfold. Known for
              his exceptional drumming skills and creative contributions to the
              band's music, The Rev played a pivotal role in shaping their sound
              and identity. With his unique blend of technical proficiency and
              creativity, he helped define Avenged Sevenfold's signature style,
              which fuses elements of metal, punk, and hard rock. Aside from his
              drumming abilities, The Rev was also a talented songwriter,
              contributing to many of the band's biggest hits. His songwriting
              often showcased his eclectic musical influences, ranging from
              classical music to punk rock, resulting in dynamic and diverse
              compositions. Tragically, The Rev passed away on December 28,
              2009, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire fans and
              musicians alike. His impact on the world of rock music is
              undeniable, and his memory lives on through Avenged Sevenfold's
              music and the countless lives he touched with his talent and

              heavy metal band Avenged Sevenfold, released on June 2, 2023,
              through Warner Records. Its release follows nearly seven years
              after its predecessor, The Stage (2016), marking the band's
              longest gap between studio albums to date. It is also the first
              album to feature contributions from their late drummer Jimmy "The
              Rev" Sullivan since Nightmare (2010). Similar to The Stage, Life
              Is But a Dream... was produced by the band with Joe Barresi. It
              marks the band's return to Warner following a legal dispute
              between the band and Warner Music in the mid-2010s. Life Is But a
              Dream... received acclaim from music critics for its themes,
              experimental approach, and blend of influences and genres. Despite
              the critical praise, the album was less commercially successful
              than the band's previous albums.
